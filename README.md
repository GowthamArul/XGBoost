# XGBoost

• XGBoost or Extreme gradient boosting is the algorithm of choice for many data scientists and could be used for regression and classification tasks.
• XGBoost is a supervised learning algorithm and implements gradient boosted trees algorithm.
• The algorithm work by combining an ensemble of predictions from several weak models.
• It is robust to many data distributions and relationships and offers many hyperparameters to tune model performance.
• Xgboost offers increased speed and enhanced memory utilization.
• Xgboost is analogous to the idea of “discovering truth by building on previous discoveries”.
